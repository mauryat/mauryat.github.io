Ethereum, Ethereum, Ethereum

That's all I hear all day. My friend started the chant, and it's now spread to all my roommates. Everyone is investing in crypto-currency. We hear stories not unfrequently about how a friend (we don't know if one such human exists) of our ffriend recently earned $350k with a $20k investment in Ethereum. Of course, it's quite possible, given that Ethereum has grown by a few hundred times. Now, all that makes us also feel like we are going to be the next lucky ones.

Or, have we missed the boat? Is Ethereum maxed out? Is that only once in a generation kind of luck?

Ethereum is among the top 3 cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology is used to maintain a public record of all transactions.
